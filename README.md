# .NET Utils

This repository contains utilities that might come in handy in .NET projects.

## Structure

The repository is divided into projects based on the type of utilities. Each project has its tests located in project(s)
in the _Tests_ folder. The name of said project(s) always starts with the name of the project being tested, followed by
the type of tests.

For details about each individual project see the _README.md_ file in said project. The complete structure is as
follows:

* [Core](Core/README.md)

## Disclaimer

The main purpose of this repository is for it to be my personal sandbox where I can experiment with .NET code, NuGet
packaging, writing tests and overall have fun.

One of the nice by-products of my endeavors is the ability to reuse any code written here in my other (very often)
private projects.

Even thought I try to come up with the code myself, I cannot deny being (at least somewhat) influenced by ideas from
across the internet (mostly StackOverflow). Therefore, feel free to get inspired here or just copy-paste anything you
find here.

If you believe I could use some advice on how to do (any of these) things, feel free to let me know by reaching me
personally or simply opening a new issue. However, I would like to point out in advance that I reserve the right to
ignore _any_ suggestions (oh yes, even the good ones), although I will do my best to not exercise this right too often.
